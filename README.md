# NewsfeedUI

This workshop covers building a Newsfeed app using SwiftUI, and it's meant to be used for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit. This workshop covers the basics of Swift, iOS, SwiftUI, and building apps with Xcode.

## Requirements

This project has been updated to work with Xcode 13.2.1, Swift 5.5, and iOS 15.2. Xcode 13.2.1 requires a Mac running macOS 11.3 Big Sur or later.

* Download Xcode [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Content

In this repo, you'll find two versions of the NewsfeedUI App: a starter project and the completed project.

To get started, open the `Newsfeed-Starter.xcodeproj` file located in the `NewsfeedUI-Starter` directory. Please refer to the [Step By Step Instructions](./StepByStepInstructions.md) for detailed instructions on building this app. During the workshop you can use these instructions to follow along.

## App Design

SwiftUI allows you to customize any UI element in several ways. For example, text can be customized with different colors, fonts, backgrounds or rotation effects.
