# NewsfeedUI

This is a workshop covers building a Newsfeed app using SwiftUI, and is meant to be used for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit. This workshop we'll cover the basics of Swift, iOS, SwiftUI, and building apps with Xcode.

## Requirements

This project has been updated to work with Xcode 12.3, Swift 5.3, and iOS 14.3.

## Content

In this repo, you'll find two versions of the NewsfeedUI App: a starter project and the completed project.

To get started, open the `Newsfeed-Starter.xcodeproj` file located in the `NewsfeedUI-Starter` directory. Please refer to the [Step By Step Instructions](./StepByStepInstructions.md) for detailed instructions on building this app. During the workshop you can use these instructions to follow along.

## Bonus Functionality
