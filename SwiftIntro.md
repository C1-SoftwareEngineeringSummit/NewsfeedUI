# Swift Intro
## Variables and Constants
Prereqs: import `Foundation` and `UIKit`

Declare a variable with the `var` keyword.
```swift
var str = "Hello, playground" // str is of type string
str = 5 // This is an error, compiler won't let you assign an Int to a type String 
```
Swift is a type safe language, meaning once a variable is declared as a certain type, it must maintain that type.

If you don’t specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference.
```swift
var currency = 5    // This infers the type to be Int
var currency: Double = 5
print(currency)
```

Declare a constant with the `let` keyword.
```swift
// cmd + ctrl + space to get emojis
let emoji = "😬"     // The String type is built from Unicode scalar values
emoji = "🤪" // Cannot assign to value: 'emoji' is a 'let' constant
```

Yay! no semicolons

## Control Flow
Let’s talk about control flow: Starting with loops
You use the `for-in` loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string.
```swift
for character in "The Great British Baking Show 🍰" {
    print(character)
}
```

You can also use `for-in` loops with numeric ranges. 
In this example we use the closed range operator (...) to iterate from 1 to 5 inclusive.
```swift
for index in 1...5 { // Equivalent to for(index = 1; index <= 5; index++)
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}
```
**String interpolation** is a way to construct a new `String` value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal.
Use the half-open range operator (..<) to include the lower bound but not the upper bound.

Next we’ll use conditionals.
```swift
let temperature = 40
if temperature <= 32 {
    print("It's freezing!")
} else {
    print ("It's not that cold")
}
```

Yay! no parenthesis. Swift syntax is pretty light.

## Functions
Use the `func` keyword and indicate the function’s return type with the **return arrow**->
```swift
func greet(person: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(person)"
}

print(greet(person: "Merlin"))
```
Notice the argument label for each parameter. 
Each function parameter has both an *argument label* and a *parameter name*. The argument label is used when calling the function; each argument is written in the function call with its argument label before it. You can also omit the argument label by passing in an underscore `_` instead of an explicit label for that parameter. 
```swift
func greet(_ person: String, from hometown: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, \(person)! Glad you could visit from \(hometown)."
}

print(greet("Chris", from: "El Paso"))
```

Argument labels can allow a function to be called in an expressive, sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that is readable and clear in intent.

### Closures
Functions in Swift are actually special types of closures, self-contained blocks of code that can be called later. Closures can be invoked similar to functions: 

```swift
let genericGreeting = {
    return "Hello!"
}
print(genericGreeting())

// closures can have parameters and return types
let customGreeting: (String) -> (String) = { person in 
    return "Hello, \(person)"
}
print(customGreeting("Newton"))

// more complicated
let strings = ["x", "z", "d", "f", "a"]
strings.sorted(by: <)
// same as
strings.sorted(by: { name1, name2 in
    return name1 < name2
})
```

## Optionals
You use *optionals* in situations where a value may be absent. An optional represents two possibilities: Either there *is* a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there *isn’t* a value at all.
```swift
// Typical situation in java...
// if someVar != nil {
//    do something with someVar
// }
```

In Swift we declare a property that is optional with the `?`  operator after the type declaration.
```swift
var optionalString: String? = "hello"
```

You use *optional binding* to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable.
```swift
if let actualString = optionalString {
    print(actualString)
}
```
Think of an optional as a wrapper type. It’s like a gift box which wraps the value inside, and like a real-life box, the optional can either contain something or be empty.

Another example:
```swift
let possibleNumber = "123"  // What if this wasn't a number?
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)
print(convertedNumber)

if let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {
    print(convertedNumber)
}
```
Because the initializer might fail, it returns an *optional* Int, rather than an Int.

`guard` statements are similar to `if let` but can allow you to provide an early return when optionals are `nil`.
```swift
func getPaid(amount: Int?) -> String {
    guard let amount = amount else {
        return "No money 😭"
    }
    return "I got paid $\(amount)"
}

print(getPaid(amount: nil))
```

## Classes vs Structs
```swift
class Article {
    var title: String

    init(title: String) {
        self.title = title
    }
}

var article1 = Article(title: "Best way to avoid clickbait.")
var article2 = article1
article2.title = "Second best way to avoid clickbait."
print(article1.title)
```

Now change the class to struct. What happens? Pass by value! Passing by value is way safer than having multiple references to the same instance.

### Protocols
Same idea as interfaces in java. They define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements and can be adopted by classes, structs, and enums. Properties declared in protocols must always be variable (var), and can either be gettable { get }, or gettable AND settable { get set }. Getters and setters can be defined to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.

```swift
protocol Shape {
    var sides: Int { get }
    var area: Double { get set }
    var color: UIColor? { get }
}

struct Circle: Shape {
    var sides: Int
    var area: Double {
        get {
            Double.pi * pow(Double(radius), 2)
        }
        set {
            radius = pow((newValue / Double.pi), 0.5)
        }
    }
    var radius: Double
    var color: UIColor?

    init(radius: Double) {
        self.radius = radius
        sides = 0
    }

}

var circle = Circle(radius: 5)
print(circle.area)
circle.area = 50
print(circle.radius)
```

### Property Dot Syntax
Dot syntax in Swift, just like other languages, allows you to access instance properties and enum cases by specifying the property after the owner’s name, separated by “.”
Protip: you can use the shorthand leading dot syntax by omitting the instance/enum owner's name when its type can be inferred (common in switch statements). In the previous example, try adding `circle.color = .blue`.

Bonus example with enums for The Last Airbender fans:

```swift
enum Element: String {
    case water
    case earth
    case fire
    case air
}

func benderInfo(name: String, elementType: Element) {
    var powerMove: String

    switch elementType {
    case Element.air:
        powerMove = "hurricane"
    case .earth:
        powerMove = "metalbending"
    case .fire:
        powerMove = "lightningbending"
    case .water:
        powerMove = "bloodbending"
    }

    // multiline string literal
    print(
        """
        \(name): \(elementType.rawValue)bender
        Special move: \(powerMove)

        """
    )
}

benderInfo(name: "Katara", elementType: .water)
```
